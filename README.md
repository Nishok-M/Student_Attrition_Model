# Student Attrition Model

## Project Description:
  Clearwater State University has collected student data to check the enrolment to the curriculum programs and the percentage of students continuing to the next year. It was observed that many students are opting out from continuing the next year. The rate of attrition was very high.
  Here, the goal is to,
    1. Identify key drivers of early student attrition,
    2. Build a predictive model to identify students with higher attrition risk,
    3. Recommend appropriate interventions based on analysis.
